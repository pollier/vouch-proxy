# NGINX Examples

Nginx can be used for most deployments of Vouch Proxy.  Nginx is always an appropriate choice unless you wan to do advanced authorization of users based on information being returned from Vouch Proxy.

## Configuration Examples

### Single-File
Use the single file examples when you only have one or a small number of applications you would like to proxy.  The single file examples are simple and easy to implement.

### Multi-File
Use the multi-file examples if you want to better organize your configuration files and make it easier to add/remove proxied applications.
